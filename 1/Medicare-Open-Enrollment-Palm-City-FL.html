<p>Many Medicare Supplement plans don't cover benefits like vision, dental, eyeglasses, listening to aids, or prescription drug coverage. If you need prescribed drugs, you would need to enroll in a standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan.

If your enrollment request is denied, you’ll have the chance to appeal. Although Americans who age into Medicare have the choice to place off enrolling in Part B, people who do make that alternative must proceed with caution to avoid enrollment penalties that could continue indefinitely.<p>
<p>However, home partners (same-gender and opposite-gender) are usually not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B with out incurring late enrollment penalties. These individuals are suggested to contact Social Security three months before turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred.
