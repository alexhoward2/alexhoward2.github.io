<p>Be positive to think about how you may pay for the things Medicare would not cover. For instance, it generally doesn't cover dental work and routine vision or hearing care. Same goes for long-time period care, beauty procedures and — for the jet-setters — medical care overseas. "About a month or two earlier than you flip 65, you'll be routinely enrolled, and your card will simply present up within the mail," Roberts said.<p>
