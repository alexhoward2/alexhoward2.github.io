<p>If you aren't signing up for Medicare at sixty five and at present have firm provided group coverage, are you required to confirm this with Medicare?

<p>Medicare Part A offers FFS funds for admitted in-patient hospital care, hospice, and expert nursing companies if an individual is first admitted inpatient for 3 days. Less often, listening to and wellness benefits not found in Medicare Part B are included in a Medicare Advantage or different Part C plan.

Examples of these additional providers include transport to medical-service appointments, coverage of over-the-counter medication, adult day care, and assistance for every day dwelling.<p>

You cannot, however, pair a Medigap coverage with an Advantage Plan.<p>
