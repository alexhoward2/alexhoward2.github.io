You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
<p>Even if you use certainly one of these different playing cards, you also could also be asked to show your Medicare card, so hold it with you.

In this instance, you might pay your Part B monthly premium, plus 30%, for so long as you've Part B. If you’re not eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A, you will want to sign up for it whenever you first turn out to be eligible to take action.<p>
