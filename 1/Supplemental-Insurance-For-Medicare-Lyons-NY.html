<p>The only exception is when you’re contributing to a health savings account and want to continue doing so. Medicare enrollees usually are not allowed to contribute to an HSA, even if they proceed to have coverage beneath an employer’s HSA-certified excessive-deductible health plan. That mentioned, it usually pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even if you have health coverage already. It won’t cost you anything, and this way, Medicare can serve as your secondary insurance and probably decide up the tab for something your main insurance doesn’t cover.

These plans are generally known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans or MA-PDs.<p>
<p>You can replace a Medicare Advantage plan with a standalone Medicare Prescription Drug plan during AEP without penalty. If you drop prescription drug coverage throughout AEP and resolve to get it again later, you might have to pay a penalty. It’s critical that employees and their dependents think about whether or not Part B is correct for them when they’re first eligible for Medicare.<p>
<h3>Health Insurance in Lyons: The Race Against the Clock</h3>
<p>You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan if you’re first eligible for Medicare, or during the annual Medicare open enrollment period in the fall .

You can join Medicare Part B at any time that you have coverage via present or active employment. Or you'll be able to sign up for Medicare through the eight-month Special Enrollment Period that starts when your employer or union group coverage ends otherwise you cease working . If you get COBRA or retiree benefits after you stop working, understand that this doesn’t depend as coverage based mostly on present employment; ensure you don’t wait until your COBRA benefits finish to enroll in Medicare Part B.<p>
