This comes with an employer request for info form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you just’ve had coverage via them since the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union laws mandating that you simply sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>
