<p>Enrollment in I-SNPs has been rising, but is still less than 100,000 beneficiaries. For a few years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has posted high quality rankings of Medicare Advantage plans to provide beneficiaries with further details about plans offered in their space. Prior authorization is most frequently required for relatively expensive services, similar to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B medication, but sometimes required for preventive providers. Beginning in 2019, Medicare Advantage plans can even require enrollees to use “step remedy” for Part B medication, which means that they're required to try some particular medication before they receive approval to try different drugs. In contrast to Medicare Advantage plans, traditional Medicare does not usually require prior authorization for providers, and doesn't require step therapy for Part B medication.<p>
