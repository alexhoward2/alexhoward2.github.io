If you're required to pay a premium for Part A as a retiree, you aren't required to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. However, UC does require that you simply send in a denial letter from Social Security to maintain your current coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and some have a corresponding companion plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold).
