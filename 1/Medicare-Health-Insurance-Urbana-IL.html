You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this year should you don’t need to.

You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
