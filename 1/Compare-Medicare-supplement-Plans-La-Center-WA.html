Generally talking, probably the most that can occur if you fund an HSA while being eligible for Medicare is that you simply’re assessed a tax penalty on the contributions you put in tax-free during that time. You should be okay to maintain making HSA contributions via June 2020 because Medicare retroactive benefits can only date back to your 65th birthday.<p>

<p>But 15 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries are beneath 65, and became eligible after receiving Social Security disability benefits for two years or being recognized with ALS or finish-stage renal illness. During the primary year a person is enrolled in Medicare Advantage, they can switch to Original Medicare and a Part D plan. And with some exceptions, they also have guaranteed-problem entry to a Medigap plan. Switch from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage (as long as you’re enrolled in each Medicare Part A and Part B, and you live in the Medicare Advantage plan’s service space).<p>
<p>Part D is offered via private insurance firms that have contracts with the federal government. If you could have traditional Medicare and wish Part D coverage you must buy it individually.<p>
<p>Be sure to think about how you will pay for the issues Medicare would not cover. For occasion, it usually doesn't cover dental work and routine imaginative and prescient or hearing care.
