<p>However, home partners (same-gender and opposite-gender) are usually not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B with out incurring late enrollment penalties. These people are advised to contact Social Security three months before turning age sixty five to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred.
