<p>You can avoid a pricey penalty when you meet the factors outlined in this SEP.

<p>Medicare beneficiaries may enroll by way of the CMS Medicare Online Enrollment Center located at A Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service plan is not a Medicare supplement plan. Providers who do not contract with the plan are not required to see you except in an emergency. Medicare beneficiaries with larger incomes could also be required to pay both a Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount .
