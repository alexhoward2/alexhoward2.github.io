You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this 12 months when you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of when you enroll well after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
