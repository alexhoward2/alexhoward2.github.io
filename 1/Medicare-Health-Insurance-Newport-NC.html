Medicare MSA Plans mix a high deductible Medicare Advantage Plan and a belief or custodial savings account (as defined and/or permitted by the IRS).<p>
<p>This implies that you have to enroll in Medicare when you're eligible after which TRICARE will fill in the gaps for some providers that Medicare doesn't cover.

<p>If you’re lined underneath a spouse’s group health plan at an organization with 20 or more staff, you do not want to sign up for Medicare at 65.
