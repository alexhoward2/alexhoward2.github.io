<p>The only exception is should you’re contributing to a health savings account and wish to proceed doing so.

That said, it typically pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even in case you have health coverage already. It received’t cost you anything, and this fashion, Medicare can function your secondary insurance and doubtlessly choose up the tab for anything your main insurance doesn’t cover.
