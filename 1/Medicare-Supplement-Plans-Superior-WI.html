<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, might be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to enroll in Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
