<p>Coverage from an employer by way of the SHOP Marketplace is treated the same as coverage from any job-based health plan.

<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 have to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they should enroll in Part B or not.
