<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the excellent payments, shall be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign up to avoid tax penalties as a result of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Though you don’t have to enroll in Medicare at age 65 in case you have coverage through a certified group health plan, doing so might make sense if that plan isn’t closely subsidized by your employer.<p>
