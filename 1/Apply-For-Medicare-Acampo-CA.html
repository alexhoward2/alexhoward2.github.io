If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare well after 65, you must half HSA contributions six months before you signal as much as avoid tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can proceed contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll nicely after age 65 (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
