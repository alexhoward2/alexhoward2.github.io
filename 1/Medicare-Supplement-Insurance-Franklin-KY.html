<p>He works part time, has insurance from his previous employer of 35 yrs and we both have coverage on this plan.

You’re eligible to enroll in Medicare Part D as long as you've both Medicare Part A or Part B.<p>
<p>If you might be turning 65 and have employer-primarily based coverage via your personal job, you possibly can delay signing up. Is the insurance via your work, or do you purchase it separately/individually?

I will flip sixty five on July 6, 2020 so I will begin Medicare on July 1, 2020. I will retire from my large employer on June 30, 2020 and that would be the final day of my health coverage via my employer.<p>
