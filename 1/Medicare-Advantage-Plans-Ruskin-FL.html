PPOs typically let members get care outside the plan's network, however members may have to pay extra for such care.

<p>The Medicare Rights Center was not capable of affirm that all ministries work this way, but it would be sensible for you to contemplate that your ministry has such a requirement. Your evaluation should include whether there's coverage for prescribed drugs. These are not coated by Parts A or B, but normally require a Part D drug plan from a private insurer.
