<p>Medicare is a nationwide medical health insurance program that covers hundreds of thousands of people and includes a fair greater variety of healthcare suppliers and companies. If you have missed the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment period, there's a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 yearly.

If your Medicare coverage has started and you need to drop Part B, contact Social Security for instructions on how to submit a signed request. Your coverage will end the primary day of the month after Social Security gets your request. If you might be under sixty five and receiving certain disability benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, you'll be mechanically enrolled in Original Medicare, Part A and Part B, after 24 months of disability benefits.<p>
