<p>Prior authorization is most often required for relatively expensive providers, corresponding to inpatient hospital stays, expert nursing facility stays, and Part B drugs, and is occasionally required for preventive providers. The variety of enrollees in plans that require prior authorization for one or more companies increased from 2019 to 2020, from seventy nine% in 2019 to ninety nine% in 2020. Some urban areas, similar to Baltimore City (18%) and Cook County, IL (Chicago, 26%) have low Medicare Advantage enrollment, compared to the national average (36%).

In 2020, about 500 plans will provide roughly as much as 2.6 million Medicare Advantage enrollees with access to expanded primarily health associated supplemental benefits, similar to grownup care providers or caregiver assist providers.<p>
