<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding payments, will be coated by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to join Medicare this year if you don’t need to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you sign as much as keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to cease contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
