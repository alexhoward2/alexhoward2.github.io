You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t wish to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare.
