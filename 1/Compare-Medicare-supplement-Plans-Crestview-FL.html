<p>I am now waiting to see what, if any of the outstanding bills, might be lined by Medicare Part A. Thank you in your assist Mr. Backman. You don’t have to sign up for Medicare this yr if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after sixty five, you must half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to keep away from tax penalties because of Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because should you enroll properly after age sixty five (which it sounds like you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

MSA plans don’t cover prescription drugs, but you can enroll in a standalone Part D plan individually. Medical Savings Account plans Medical Savings Account plans mix a excessive-deductible health plan with a particular savings account.

<p>If you retain the Medicare card, you retain Part B and will need to pay Part B premiums.
