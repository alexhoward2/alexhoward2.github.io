<p>As a common rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) previous age sixty five need to discuss with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether or not they need to enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form often known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage via them because the month you turned 65, thus qualifying you for particular enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not familiar with union legal guidelines mandating that you sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>

At that time, you would want to enroll in Part B, however would possibly no longer qualify for the SEP should you delayed enrolling for greater than eight months.
