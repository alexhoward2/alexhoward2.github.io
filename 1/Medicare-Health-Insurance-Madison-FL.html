Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare versions and some have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your existing retiree plan has a Medicare version or partner plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan if you turn 65, as soon as Medicare has accredited your enrollment form.<p>
<p>If you did not enroll in prescription drug coverage throughout IEP, you'll be able to join prescription drug coverage during the Annual Election Period that runs every year from October 15 to December 7.
