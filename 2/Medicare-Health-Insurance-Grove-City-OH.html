They also may supply additional benefits similar to Part D prescription drug coverage, dental, imaginative and prescient, listening to, and companies such as acupuncture, meals, caregiver support, and more. The Medicare Advantage common month-to-month premium would be the lowest in 14 years for the over 26 million Medicare beneficiaries projected to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan for 2021.
