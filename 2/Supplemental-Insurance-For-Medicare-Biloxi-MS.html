That mentioned, it usually pays to enroll in Medicare Part A on time even if you have health coverage already. It received’t cost you anything, and this manner, Medicare can function your secondary insurance and probably decide up the tab for something your primary insurance doesn’t cover. If you do not sign up for Part B if you're first eligible, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty.<p>
<p>As a basic rule, people who plan to proceed to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 need to confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not.
