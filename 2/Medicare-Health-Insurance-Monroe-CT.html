When very small employers be part of together with other employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide main coverage so long as at least one of many employers has 20+ employees. But employers can even ask for exceptions to the first/secondary rule in that circumstance, so he’ll need to check along with his group plan to see what their specific guidelines are.
