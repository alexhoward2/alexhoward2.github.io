You could choose not to enroll in Medicare Part B if you end up first eligible because you are already covered by group medical insurance through an employer or union.<p>
<p>If you’re drawing Social Security, you’ll be automatically enrolled. You can join or postpone your Part B by contacting the Social Security Administration directly.<p>
<p>When you begin Part B, it triggers a special election period that allows you to make changes to your coverage outdoors of the standard enrollment durations. If you don’t enroll in Medicare Part B during your initial enrollment period, you've one other chance each year to enroll throughout a “basic enrollment period” from January 1 through March 31.
