Many beneficiaries are routinely eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A coverage; for instance, those who have labored or spouses have worked a minimum of 10 years, or 40 quarters, and paid Medicare taxes via their employment.

When very small employers join together with different employers in conditions like this, the plan will provide major coverage as long as no less than one of the employers has 20+ workers.
