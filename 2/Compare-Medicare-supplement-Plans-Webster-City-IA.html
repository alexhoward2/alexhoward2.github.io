You could then need to pay a late-enrollment penalty for Medicare Part B because you might have had Part B and didn't enroll. If you owe a late-enrollment penalty, you’ll pay a ten% higher premium for each 12-month interval that you just had been eligible for Medicare Part B but didn’t sign up for it.

Meant to add to my drawback shown above — a Social Security employee advised me that to keep away from starting Medicare on my sixty fifth birthday, regardless of after I apply, I would have needed to make the request six months BEFORE my 65th birthday.<p>
<p>And Medicare will certainly not require you to keep it once you sign up. Once your group health coverage ends, you get a particular enrollment period that lasts eight months.
