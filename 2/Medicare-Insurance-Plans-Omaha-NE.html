At that time, you would want to enroll in Part B, however might not qualify for the SEP if you delayed enrolling for more than eight months. If you’re happy together with your present Medicare plan, you don’t must take any motion.

Both stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans and MA-PDs have the flexibility to vary the cost-sharing design of their Part D benefit; however, CMS limits the plans’ deductibles and in 2017 the deductible can't exceed $400.
