You can continue contributing to your HSA so long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare as a result of if you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
