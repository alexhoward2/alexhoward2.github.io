<p>However, home partners (same-gender and opposite-gender) are often not eligible to defer enrollment into Part B with out incurring late enrollment penalties. These individuals are advised to contact Social Security three months earlier than turning age 65 to inquire about Part B enrollment options and whether late enrollment penalties apply if enrollment is deferred. The guidelines are totally different for employees and retirees; so to be sure you enroll correctly, keep away from Medicare premium penalties and perceive how Medicare works with your UC-sponsored medical plan, comply with these steps. If you don't make any changes during AEP, your present plan will routinely renew the next yr.
