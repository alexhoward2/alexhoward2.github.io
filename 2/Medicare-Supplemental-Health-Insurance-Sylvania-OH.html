Krugman cites all of the familiar figures from the remainder of the developed world, where some mix of public insurance with some private elements manages to cover almost everyone and at a much lower cost than in the United States. But that much less-private system of health care been taken off the desk in this country by the private company pursuits who revenue from the costly mess of a health care system we now have now.
