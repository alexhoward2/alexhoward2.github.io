<p>Advantage plans supply additional coverage like listening to companies, prescription drug coverage, dental providers, and imaginative and prescient care.

Sending in the information by this date allows for the well timed processing of your enrollment into the Medicare plan. Ninety days before your 65th birthday, RASC will send you a letter with details about enrolling in Medicare. Remember, you and/or your spouse can hold off on enrolling in Medicare so long as you’re working — just make sure to enroll if you retire.<p>
