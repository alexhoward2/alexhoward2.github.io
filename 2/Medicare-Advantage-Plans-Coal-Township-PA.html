<p>As a general rule, individuals who plan to continue to work (and have employer-sponsored health coverage) past age 65 must confer with the employer-sponsored health plan to see whether they should enroll in Part B or not. This comes with an employer request for data form known as L564. Your employer can fill in that you simply’ve had coverage via them since the month you turned sixty five, thus qualifying you for special enrollment into Medicare Part B. Unfortunately I’m not acquainted with union legal guidelines mandating that you simply sign up for Medicare at a given time.<p>

Enroll within the prescription drug plan whenever you’re first eligible to do so, during the IEP for Part D.<p>
<p>But when you enrolled in Medicare despite having health coverage, it leads me to imagine that your employer coverage left some gaps, which is why you selected Medicare.
