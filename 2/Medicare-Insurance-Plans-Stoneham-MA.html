<p>It will also be necessary to grasp the implications for beneficiaries in both Medicare Advantage plans and traditional Medicare, in terms of costs, benefits, premiums, high quality of care, patient outcomes, and entry to providers. After exceeding this catastrophic threshold, beneficiaries pay 5 percent of the cost of medication.
