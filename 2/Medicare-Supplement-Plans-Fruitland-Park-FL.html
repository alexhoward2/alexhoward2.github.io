You don’t have to join Medicare this 12 months if you don’t want to. If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare properly after 65, you need to half HSA contributions six months before you sign up to avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months prior to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll nicely after age sixty five (which it sounds such as you’re planning to do), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>
