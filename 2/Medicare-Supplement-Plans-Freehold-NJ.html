<p>You do not want to sign up when you routinely get Part A and Part B. You'll getyour pink, white, and blue Medicare cardin the mail the month your disability benefits begin. You routinely get Part A and Part B the month your disability benefits begin. You don’t want to enroll when you mechanically get Part A and Part B. You'll getyour red, white, and blue Medicare cardin the mail three months before your twenty fifth month of disability. NoteIf you do not qualify for premium-free Part A, you should sign up for Part B to be able to purchase Part A.<p>
<p>For example, should you waited for 3 years to enroll, your penalty could be 30% of the premium. In this example, you would possibly pay your Part B month-to-month premium, plus 30%, for as long as you could have Part B. If you’re not eligible for premium-free Medicare Part A, you will want to enroll in it if you first become eligible to do so.<p>
