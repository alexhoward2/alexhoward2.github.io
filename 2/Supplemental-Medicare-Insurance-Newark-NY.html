<p>People who aren’t yet amassing Social Security, or aren’t eligible for Social Security Retirement, aren’t mechanically enrolled into Medicare. Some people get Medicare Part A and Part B automatically and some folks need to join them.<p>
<p>An enrollee may also should pay a month-to-month premium to the MA plan, copays and coinsurance. Many MA plans have prescription drug coverage in-built to the benefit bundle.
