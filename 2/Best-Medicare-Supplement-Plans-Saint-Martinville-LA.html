And with some exceptions, they also have assured-concern access to a Medigap plan. Switch from Original Medicare to Medicare Advantage (so long as you’re enrolled in each Medicare Part A and Part B, and you live in the Medicare Advantage plan’s service area).<p>
<p>If it pays secondary to Medicare, whether or not and the way it pays if they don’t enroll in Part A and/or Part B.
