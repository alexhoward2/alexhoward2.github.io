<p>I am now ready to see what, if any of the excellent payments, shall be covered by Medicare Part A. Thank you for your help Mr. Backman.

If you’ll be enrolling in Medicare nicely after 65, you should half HSA contributions six months earlier than you signal as much as avoid tax penalties due to Medicare’s retroactive benefits rule. You can continue contributing to your HSA as long as you’re not on Medicare. It’s advisable to stop contributions six months previous to retiring/signing up for Medicare because if you enroll properly after age 65 (which it sounds such as you’re planning on doing), you do get six months of retroactive Medicare coverage.<p>

Sending in the information by this date allows for the timely processing of your enrollment into the Medicare plan. Ninety days before your sixty fifth birthday, RASC will ship you a letter with information about enrolling in Medicare. Remember, you and/or your partner can maintain off on enrolling in Medicare as long as you’re working — just remember to enroll if you retire.<p>
