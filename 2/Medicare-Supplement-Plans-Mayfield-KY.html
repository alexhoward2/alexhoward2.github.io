Medicare Part B isn’t a legal requirement, and also you don’t want it in some situations. In common, when you’re eligible for Medicare and have creditable coverage, you can postpone Part B penalty-free. Creditable coverage includes the insurance offered to you or your partner through work.<p>
<p>When you start Part B, it triggers a special election interval that permits you to make changes to your coverage outdoors of the standard enrollment durations.

<p>These revenue limits apply in 2020, and are listed for inflation. There is no longer a donut gap in terms of the maximum quantity that enrollees may be charged after they fill prescriptions. But the donut hole still exists by way of how insurers design their coverage , how total drug costs are counted, and who covers the majority of the price of the drugs (the drug plan versus the producer; see Figure four right here).<p>
