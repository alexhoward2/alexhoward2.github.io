<p>When you file on your own retirement benefit, you will obtain an extra payment roughly equal to the quantity by which your retirement benefit exceeds your spousal benefit.

<p>To request a reduction in that revenue-associated amount as a result of a life-changing event like retiring, the Social Security Administration has a form you possibly can fill out. Some recipients will not pay the full $a hundred and forty four.60 normal premium because of a "maintain innocent" provision that forestalls their Part B premiums from rising greater than their Social Security cost-of-dwelling adjustment, or COLA.

<p>You don’t want to sign up should you routinely get Part A and Part B. You'll getyour pink, white, and blue Medicare cardin the mail three months before your sixty fifth birthday.
