Beneficiaries with diagnoses of ESRD sometimes incur higher costs than the typical beneficiary, and CMS is making these changes to out-of-pocket maximums to higher mirror beneficiary spending.<p>
<p>MA plans could charge cost-sharing for a service that is above or under the standard Medicare cost-sharing for that service.
