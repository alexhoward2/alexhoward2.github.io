<p>Medicare is a national health insurance program that covers millions of individuals and involves an even larger number of healthcare suppliers and companies. If you've missed the Fall Medicare Open Enrollment period, there is a Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 every year.
