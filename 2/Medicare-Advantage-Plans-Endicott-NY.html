However, UC does require that you just send in a denial letter from Social Security to keep your current coverage. Some of UC’s retiree medical plans have Medicare variations and a few have a corresponding partner plan (UC Care, CORE, UC Blue & Gold). If your current retiree plan has a Medicare version or companion plan, you’ll be transferred into that plan when you turn 65, as soon as Medicare has accredited your enrollment form.<p>
