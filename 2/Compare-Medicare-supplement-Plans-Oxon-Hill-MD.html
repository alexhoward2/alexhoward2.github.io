About 7% of Medicare's 61 million or so beneficiaries can pay more due to these income-adjusted quantities .<p>
<p>They are labeled Plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N, every with a special standardized coverage set. Some plans embody emergency medical benefits during international travel. Since coverage is standard, there are no scores of Medigap policies.<p>
