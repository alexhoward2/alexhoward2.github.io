<p>Can I continue to make HSA contribution through June 2020, or do I have to cease 6 months before July 1, 2020. My husband is popping 65 right here in April, hes not planning on retiring until late fall possibly? He works for a metropolis in a small town and ther are solely two workers, but they are in a bunch medical plan with different cities.

<p>If you’re covered beneath a partner’s group health plan at a company with 20 or extra employees, you do not need to enroll in Medicare at 65. The six months of retroactive benefits applies whenever you enroll in Medicare after sixty five. At that point it’s automatic and you'll’t settle for or reject it – it simply occurs.
