<p> Turning 65 is the set off level for the vast majority of Americans to enroll in Medicare.

<p>But these averages masks extensive regional and helpful variations. Just as an important good thing about Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the most important determinant of monthly premium variations is the size of that protection.
