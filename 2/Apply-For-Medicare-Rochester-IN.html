<p>Plan costs are generally lower than these of other Medicare Advantage plan varieties, but you’re normally limited to medical doctors within the plan’s provider network. Medicare Advantage plans might provide further (“supplemental”) benefits that are not offered in conventional Medicare, and can use rebate dollars to help cover the cost of extra benefits.
